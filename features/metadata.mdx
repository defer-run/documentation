## Overview

Defer enables you to attach metadata (key/value pairs) to an execution. This is
useful for example if you want search all executions for a specific user.

## Requirements

Below the list of requirements we apply on metadata:

- No more than 25 metadata (key/value pairs) per exection
- key & value format:
  - Must be a string.
  - Must have lenght between 1 and 256.
  - Must only only contain printable ASCII characters (ASCII code must be
    between 32 and 127).

## Example

```ts
import { addMetadata } from "@defer/client";
import { sayHello } from "./defer/sayHello";

const delayedSayHello = addMetadata(sayHello, {
  userId: "7",
  email: "john@example.com",
});
await delayedSayHello("John Doe");
```
