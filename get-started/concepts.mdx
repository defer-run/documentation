## Background Functions

Contrary to the Queue's _status-quo_ of _Producers_ and _Consumers_, Defer brings the concept of _Background Functions_ as a basic unit of work:

```tsx defer/importContacts.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function importContacts(userId: string) {
  // ... import contacts from Hubspot
}

export default defer(importContacts, { concurrency: 2, retry: 2 });
```

Enqueuing an execution is achieved by simply calling _Background Functions_ (_Producer_ pattern):

```tsx api.ts
import express from "express";

import importContacts from "./defer/importContacts";

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // calling a background function triggers an execution on Defer Platform
  await importContacts(req.session.userId);

  res.send("Import started!");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Calling a _Background Function_ (`await importContacts();`) triggers a call to the [Defer API](/references/defer-api) to enqueue an _Execution_ on [The Defer Platform](/platform/runner/overview).

## Builds & Executions

### Builds

Defer [builds your _Background Function_ into optimized bundles](/platform/builder/compiling) to run pending _Executions_ in [isolated containers](/platform/runner/environment).

A Defer Build extracts the _Background Function_ defined in your project with their configuration:

### Executions

_Executions_ get processed based on their [schedule](/features/scheduled-execution) and available account [concurrency capacity](/features/concurrency-resources).

Each _Execution_ benefits from dedicated resources and rich runtime supporting native dependencies and local imports.

Finally, _Executions_ comes with detailed timings, logs in the Console, and quick actions such as rerun or cancel:
