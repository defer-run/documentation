## Setup

<Snippet file="install-defer-client.mdx" />

### Create a `defer/` folder

Defer expects to find all the background functions in the `defer/` folder:

```txt
.
|-- src
|   |-- defer/
|   |-- api.ts
|-- package.json
|-- tsconfig.json
`-- yarn.lock
```

<Note>

**Notes:**

- The `defer/` folder can be located anywhere in your project
- The `defer/` folder can contain nested folders

</Note>

### Write a background function

A background function is a function equivalent to a background job.

All background functions must live in the `defer/` folder.

Choose how to write your first background function:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title={"Start with the helloWorld() demo function"}>

Let's add the following `helloWorld.ts` function in your `defer/` folder, as
follows:

```ts src/defer/helloWorld.ts
// the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

// a background function must be `async`
async function helloWorld(name: string) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
      resolve("done");
    }, 5000);
  });
}

// the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
export default defer(helloWorld);
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"I got a use case: a new feature or slow code to move in the background"}>

You already have a use case? Sounds great!

Start by first creating a background function in the `defer/` folder and see how
to implement it depending on your use case:

<Tabs>

  <Tab title='Move existing slow code to a background function'>

    ```ts src/defer/syncContacts.ts
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import syncContacts from "../utils/syncContacts"

    // the imported function must be wrapped with `defer()` and re-exported as default
    export default defer(syncContacts)
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title='Write a new feature, ex: syncContacts()'>

    ```ts src/defer/syncContacts.ts
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"

    interface Contact { /* ... */ }

    // a background function must be `async`
    async function syncContacts(contacts: Contact) {
      // ...
    }

    // the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
    export default defer(syncContacts)
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Our background function is ready for use; let's see how to call it from your
application.

### Call your background function

Whenever you choose to use the `helloWorld()` function or create your own, the
following example showcasing how to call `helloWorld()`, from a `/hello-world`
HTTP route, demonstrates how easily you can trigger a background function
execution.

```ts src/api.ts
import http from "http";
import helloWorld from "../defer/helloWorld";

http
  .createServer(async function (req, res) {
    await helloWorld(req.query.name || "World");

    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
    res.write(JSON.stringify({ ok: true }));
    res.end();
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

<Note>
**How does Defer work?**

If you are wondering how calling a background function triggers an execution on
Defer, please refer to this guide: [How Defer works](/get-started/concepts).

</Note>

Once your HTTP route is defined, please commit and push it to your branch.

Now that your app contains a background function and an API route that calls it;
let's ensure your Defer token is configured correctly.

## Configure

<Snippet file="setup-defer-app.mdx" />

<Snippet file="api-deployment-configuration.mdx" />

## Deploy

Now, with your API deployment containing your Defer Token and your project's
builds ready on Defer, open your browser and test the HTTP route.

In the `helloWorld()` background function scenario, visit the `/` route.

You should see that your API answered quickly, and by going to your
[Defer Console](https://console.defer.run/), you should see that your background
function has 1 execution running - or finished:

<Frame caption="Your first function on the Defer Console">
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/functions-list.png"
    alt="Your first function on the Defer Console"
  />
</Frame>

By clicking on see executions, you will access the executions list:

<Frame caption="Your first successful function un on the Defer Console">
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/function-runs.png"
    alt="Your first successful function un on the Defer Console"
  />
</Frame>
