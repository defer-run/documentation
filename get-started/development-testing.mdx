## Local Development

The good news is that Defer works locally by default; without a specific
command.

**How?**

Locally, background functions run in the background leveraging the
[Promise API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise),
providing a behavior similar to production environments, with some limitations.

<Warning>
  We don't recommend setting a `DEFER_TOKEN` locally. By doing so, all calls to
  your background functions will run on the Defer Platform, preventing you from
  debugging locally.
</Warning>

### Development Limitations

Defer relies on the
[Promise API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
to execute background functions locally; it means that all executions are bound
to the parent process and will be canceled if the parent process (ex: local
server) crashed or is stopped.

Given this limitation, here is the [`@defer/client`](/references/overview)
local development support matrix:

|Feature|Local support|Details|
|---|---|---|
|Immediate execution| ✅ |   |
|`defer()` - `concurrency` option| ✅ |   |
|`defer()` - `maxDuration` option| ❌ |   |
|`defer()` - `retry` option| ❌ |   |
|`defer()` - `maxConcurrencyAction` option| ❌ |   |
|`cancelExecution()` | ✅ |   |
|`awaitResult()` | ✅ |   |
|`assignOptions()` option| ❌ | *`delay` and `discardAfter` are not supported locally* |
|`rescheduleExecution()` | ❌ |   |
|`delay()` - Delayed execution| ❌ | *will result in executing the function immediately* |
|`defer.cron()`| ❌ | *CRONs do not get scheduled locally. You can still test them like regular defer functions though.* |



### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I debug my background functions without the Defer Console?">

Locally, background functions get executed on your machine using the JavaScript
Promise API.

Local executions won't appear on your Defer Dashboard; however, all logs printed
by your background functions will show in your local API server terminal.

Similarly, when executed locally, background functions can benefit from any
[Node.js breakpoints](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I set a `DEFER_TOKEN` locally?">

We don't recommend doing it.

By setting a `DEFER_TOKEN` locally, all calls to your background functions will
run on the Defer Platform.

It will result in executing the version of your background function present on
GitHub, not locally, which can be confusing.
