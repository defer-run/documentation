By combining **Defer** and [Resend](https://resend.com/), send and **schedule rich-styled emails in minutes**, while keeping full control over their scheduling with cancellations and the Defer Console.

This guide will show you how to implement a **monthly usage report email with an attached PDF invoice**:

**Resend**, combined with `@react-pdf/renderer` will help in **sending rich emails**.

**Defer** will help in **scheduling monthly emails** while respecting **Resend's API rate limiting and avoiding duplicate sends**
.


## Implementing the usage email

### A rich email with JSX


Resend combined with its [`@react-email/components`](https://react.email/docs/introduction), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and Defer's support for JSX enables us to write our monthly usage email with React as follows:

<Accordion title="src/emails/MonthlyUsage.tsx">
  ```tsx
  import * as React from "react";
  import {
    Body,
    Button,
    Container,
    Head,
    Heading,
    Html,
    Img,
    Preview,
    Section,
    Tailwind,
    Text,
  } from "@react-email/components";

  interface MonthlyUsageEmailProps {
    firstName: string;
    title: string;
    period: string;
    percentPlan: number;
  }

  export const MonthlyUsageEmail = ({
    firstName,
    period,
    title,
    percentPlan,
  }: MonthlyUsageEmailProps) => {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <Preview>{`Your Defer usage for ${period}`}</Preview>
        <Tailwind>
          <Body className="bg-white my-auto mx-auto font-sans">
            <Container className="border border-solid border-[#eaeaea] rounded my-[40px] mx-auto p-[20px] w-[465px]">
              <Section className="mt-[32px]">
                <Img
                  src={"https://www.defer.run/github/defer_lightmode.png"}
                  width="250"
                  height="131"
                  alt="Defer"
                  className="my-0 mx-auto"
                />
              </Section>
              <Heading className="text-black text-[24px] font-normal text-center p-0 my-[30px] mx-0">
                {title}
              </Heading>
              <Text className="text-black text-[14px] leading-[24px]">
                Hello {firstName},
              </Text>
              <Text className="text-black text-[14px] leading-[24px]">
                You used {percentPlan}% of your <strong>Pro plan</strong> capacity
                last month. <br /> You will find the detailed list of executions
                attached.
              </Text>
              <Section className="text-center mt-[32px] mb-[32px]">
                <Button
                  pX={20}
                  pY={12}
                  className="bg-[#000000] rounded text-white text-[12px] font-semibold no-underline text-center"
                  href={"#"}
                >
                  Go to the Console
                </Button>
              </Section>
            </Container>
          </Body>
        </Tailwind>
      </Html>
    );
  };

  export default MonthlyUsageEmail;
  ```
</Accordion>

The `<MonthlyUsageEmail />` component is then provided to our `sendMonthlyUsage()` function (example in a NextJS project):

```ts src/defer/sendMonthlyUsage.tsx
import { Resend } from "resend";
import MonthlyUsageEmail from "@/emails/MonthlyUsage";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!);

async function sendMonthlyUsage(userId: string) {
  const billingInfo = // ... query DB with `userId`
  const usageInfo = // ... query DB with `userId`

  const title = `You performed ${new Intl.NumberFormat().format(
    usageInfo.executions
  )} executions in ${billingInfo.period}`;

  await resend.emails.send({
    from: "usage@defer.run",
    to: "charly@defer.run",
    subject: title,
    html: title,
    react: MonthlyUsageEmail({
      firstName: billingInfo.user.firstName,
      title,
      percentPlan: usageInfo.planPercent,
      period: billingInfo.period,
    }),
  });
}
```


### Attach the PDF to the email

Our monthly usage email comes with a PDF file listing all executions performed in the given period.

[`@react-pdf/renderer`](https://react-pdf.org/), similarly to `@react-email/components` enable us to create a PDF file using React components, as follows:

```diff src/defer/sendMonthlyUsage.tsx
+import React from "react";
 import { Resend } from "resend";
+import {
+  Page,
+  Text,
+  View,
+  Document,
+  StyleSheet,
+  renderToBuffer,
+} from "@react-pdf/renderer";
 import MonthlyUsageEmail from "@/emails/MonthlyUsage";
 
+const styles = StyleSheet.create({
+  // ...
+});
+
+// PDF file listing the executions with associated usage
+const ExecutionsDetail = () => (
+  <Document>
+    <Page size="A4" style={styles.page}>
+      // ...
+    </Page>
+  </Document>
+);
+
 const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!);
 
 async function sendMonthlyUsage() {
+  const pdf = await renderToBuffer(<ExecutionsDetail />);
+
   const title = `You performed ${new Intl.NumberFormat().format(
    usageInfo.executions
  )} executions in ${billingInfo.period}`;
@@ -19,5 +57,16 @@
       percentPlan: usageInfo.planPercent,
      period: billingInfo.period,
     }),
+    attachments: [
+      {
+        content: pdf,
+        filename: "detail.pdf",
+      },
+    ],
   });
 }

```

<Info>

Resend accepts an `attachments` option taking an array of files (`Buffer` and file's name).

### Transform `sendMonthlyUsage()` into a Background Function

We simply wrap  `sendMonthlyUsage()` with [`defer()`](/references/defer-client/defer) to transform it into a Defer [Background Function](/get-started/concepts#background-functions):

```diff src/defer/sendMonthlyUsage.tsx
 import { Resend } from "resend";
+import { defer } from "@defer/client";
 import MonthlyUsageEmail from "@/emails/MonthlyUsage";
 
 const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!);
@@ -21,3 +22,8 @@
     }),
   });
 }
+
+export default defer(sendMonthlyUsage, {
+  concurrency: 10,
+  retry: 5,
+});
```

<Info>

You'll notice that we pass to `defer()` 2 options:
- a `concurrency: 10` to match Resend's 10 calls/sec policy
- a `retry` strategy to recover potential [errors](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/errors)

</Info>

Our `sendMonthlyUsage()` is now ready to be called to schedule emails.


## Scheduling the monthly usage emails


Each customer has a dedicated sliding usage window (e.g.: _From August 15th to September 16th_).


### Send the usage email on a sliding window schedule

We'll leverage Defer's [`delay()`](/references/defer-client/delay) feature to match this criteria:

```ts src/app/api/startSubscription/route.ts
import { delay } from "@defer/client";
import sendMonthlyUsage from "@/defer/sendMonthlyUsage";

export const POST = () => {
  const { current_period_end } = // ... create Subscription in Stripe

  const delayedsendMonthlyUsage = delay(sendMonthlyUsage, new Date(current_period_end));
  await delayedsendMonthlyUsage(userId);
}

```

<Info>

Each call to `sendMonthlyUsage()` from the NextJS App will trigger a background execution on **Defer**.

</Info>

We need to update `sendMonthlyUsage()` to reschedule itself for the next billing period, again by using `delay()` from `@defer/client`:

<Info>
  **What happened here?**

  The `sendMonthlyUsage()` became a recursive [Background Function](/get-started/concepts#background-functions), scheduling itself for the next usage period.
  To achieve this, we needed to move `defer(sendMonthlyUsage)` to the `deferSendMonthlyUsage` variable so we could pass it to `delay()`.

</Info>


### Handling unsubscribed customers

Customers do churn and we might want to stop sending them usage emails if they drop in the middle of a billing cycle.

For this, we will leverage [Defer's cancellations mechanism](/features/cancellation).

First, let's store the Execution ID of a planned monthly usage email, by updating `sendMonthlyUsage()` as follows:

```diff sendMonthlyUsage.ts
@@ -68,7 +68,9 @@
   });
 
   const delayedsendMonthlyUsage = delay(deferSendMonthlyUsage, new Date(billingInfo.current_period_end));
-  await delayedsendMonthlyUsage(userId);
+  const { id: nextEmailIdExecutionId } = await delayedsendMonthlyUsage(userId);
+
+  // save `nextEmailIdExecutionId` to the database
 }
 
 const deferSendMonthlyUsage = defer(sendMonthlyUsage, {
```

Then, let's update our unsubscribe API Routes to cancel any pending monthly usage email:

```ts src/app/api/cancelSubscription/route.ts
import { cancelExecution } from "@defer/client";
import sendMonthlyUsage from "@/defer/sendMonthlyUsage";

export const POST = () => {
  // ... cancel Subscription in Stripe

  const nextEmailIdExecutionId = // query using `session.userId`

  cancelExecution(nextEmailIdExecutionId)
}
```

## Wrapping up

Our application now provides **rich and personalized monthly usage emails** to our customers.

The **Defer Console** is your best companion, making it **easy to oversee all usage emails**:
