## Suggested resolutions steps

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="1. Check your `@defer/client` version">

        `@defer/client` v1.6.0 introduced a default `maxDuration` of 30 minutes by default.

        Please upgrade your `@defer/client` and can cancel the pending executions from the Console.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="2. Too many executions 'Running'?">

    Workflows, especially on the Free plan -- with a concurrency limit of `2`, can lead to a _deadlock_ situation when a parent execution is waiting on a stuck child execution, exhausting the concurrency limit.

    To resolve such an issue, wait for the child execution to timeout (default: 30min) or cancel it from the Console.

    Please consider upgrading to a Pro plan, which is better suited for workflows.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="3. Check status.defer.run">

    We might be facing some processing slow-down or outage.

    Please check on [status.defer.run](https://status.defer.run) and subscribe for future updates to be informed of the resolution.
