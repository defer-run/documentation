This page explains how to deploy and run your background jobs on the Defer
Platfom using the **Bun** runtime instead of **Node.js**.

<Note>
  If you are looking to use **Bun** only as a package manager, please refer to
  [Node.js supported package managers](/deploy/runtimes/nodejs#dependencies)
</Note>

# Runtime & client compatibility

Prior to version `1.11.0`, the @defer/client is not compatible with **Bun**.
Please update your client to a version greater than or equal to `1.11.0` to use
the **Bun** runtime.

# Setup runtime

<Note>Only versions `1.x` are supported.</Note>

To use the **Bun** runtime, add the following in the `engines` field of your
`package.json` as follows:

```json
{
  ...
  "engines": {
    "bun": "1.x"
  }
  ...
}
```

# Dependencies

<Note>
  The **Bun** package manager is the only one supported on the **Bun** runtime
  on the Defer platform.
</Note>

Here aren the details of the package manager and its corresponding installation
command ran upon deploy.
